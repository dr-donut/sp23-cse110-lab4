1) it will print "3" because it is the last value of i in the for loop, which was declared as a var
2) it will print "150" because it is the last value of discountedPrice
3) it will print "150" because it is the last value of finalPrice
4) it will return [50,100,150] because the function reduces all values of 'prices' by 'discount'
5) it will cause an error because 'i' is initialized with 'let', so 'console.log(i)' is out of scope
6) it will cause an error because the scope of 'discountedPrice' is only within the for-loop
7) it will print "150" because 'finalPrice' was defined in the same block as 'console.log(finalPrice)'
8) it will return [50,100,150]' because all variables were accessed in the proper scope
9) it will error because 'i' is defined with 'let', whose scope is limited to the for-loop
10) it will print "3" because 'length' never changes
11) it will return [50,100,150] because no variables are used out of scope

15) a == is a loose equality comparison where it will make a type conversion if necessary. a === is a strict equality comparison where the two operands must have the same type
